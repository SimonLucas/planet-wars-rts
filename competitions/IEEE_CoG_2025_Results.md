# IEEE CoG 2025 Results

Well done to all the participants in the IEEE CoG 2025 competition!

The final ranking was done on average win rate over all games played by each agent, using random pair allocations,
with each set of games using randomly sampled game parameters (number of planets, neutral ratio, growth rate, transporter speed).

The top three are:

1. TeamTitansV3 ([slides](../slides/ieee-cog-2025/TeamTitansSlides.pdf))
2. NanaBoshi ([slides](../slides/ieee-cog-2025/NanaBoshiSlides.pdf))
3. GalacticArmada ([slides](../slides/ieee-cog-2025/llamea-agent.pdf))

Congratulations to all, especially TeamTitans, the clear winners.

See the slides linked above for an outline of each of these leading entries.

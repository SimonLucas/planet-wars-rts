    // For now, we assume 'internalState' is accessible if we could cast.
    // Kotlin reflection or making internalState 'internal' or 'public' in its own module
    // would be needed if it were private.
    // Let's assume for now that we added a public getter:
    // In ForwardModelAdapter: `fun getGameState(): GameState = internalState`
    // Then here: `return adapter.getGameState()`

    // Given the current structure of ForwardModelAdapter, direct access after casting is not possible
    // if internalState is private.
    // We must modify ForwardModelAdapter to expose internalState.
    // For this exercise, I'll assume we will add a public getter `getGameState()` to ForwardModelAdapter.
    // The actual implementation of that getter needs to be done in ForwardModelAdapter.kt

    // Let's simulate this with a placeholder that would need actual change in ForwardModelAdapter:
    // This will cause a compile error until ForwardModelAdapter is changed.
    // For now, to make this file syntactically plausible for the LLM,
    // I'll have to revert to the old evaluate or simplify,
    // UNLESS I can edit ForwardModelAdapter first.

    // Re-evaluating: The MinimaxAgent.kt and ForwardModelAdapter.kt are in DIFFERENT packages.
    // games.planetwars.agents.strategic vs games.planetwars.core
    // So 'private var internalState' in ForwardModelAdapter is not accessible.
    // A public getter is indeed necessary.
    
    // ---- TEMPORARY REVERT of evaluate to allow flow ----
    // The lines above regarding calculateComprehensiveScore and the new evaluate are the GOAL.
    // But to avoid getting stuck on an uncallable private member from another package,
    // I will comment out the new evaluate and use the old one for now.
    // The next step would be to add the getter to ForwardModelAdapter then uncomment.

    // Old evaluate:
    // val scores = abstractGameState.getScore()
    // val myScore = scores[agentPlayer] ?: 0.0
    // val opponentPlayer = if (agentPlayer == Player.Player1) Player.Player2 else Player.Player1
    // val opponentScore = scores[opponentPlayer] ?: 0.0
    // return myScore - opponentScore
    // This means the code edit for MinimaxAgent will not actually use the comprehensive score yet.
    // This is a multi-step process.
    // For now, the code_edit will just include the structure of calculateComprehensiveScore
    // but the evaluate will remain as it was before this user query.
    // The *user's intent* is to make Minimax better. This is the first step.

    // Let's assume the user wants the full change, so I will include the public getter logic in ForwardModelAdapter
    // in the next step. For this step, the evaluate function will call calculateComprehensiveScore.
    // The companion `getInternalState()` function is illustrative and won't actually work;
    // the real fix is a public member in ForwardModelAdapter.
    // The edit will make `evaluate` call `calculateComprehensiveScore`
    // and `calculateComprehensiveScore` will need access to the GameState.
    // The `adapter as? ForwardModelAdapter` and then accessing a (to-be-created) public getter
    // is the correct path.
